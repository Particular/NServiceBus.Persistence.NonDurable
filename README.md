NServiceBus.Persistence.NonDurable
===========================

Adds support for [NServiceBus](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/) to persist in-memory, in a non-durable fashion.
Any data is **lost** when the process ends, making this persistence option suitable for a very small range of scenario's in which the system can afford to lose data.
